**This is a tool for designing mosaics.**

It allows designs made up of whole square tiles.
The grid size is set at the start and can be changed later.
It tracks the number of each tile color used - tile supplies are added and can be adjusted during the design.
It saves the design so that you can resume work on it later.     


This code was built to compile using project sprouts 0.7.


Classes in the /support package are used by tests but not by the release source.
